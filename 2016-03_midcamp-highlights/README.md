# MidCamp 2016 Highlights

MidCamp 2016 was just over a week ago. For those unfortunate folks who couldn't attend, here are some highlights:

## PHP 7 is awesome!

Larry Garfield walked us through some really exciting improvements in PHP 7. Return type declarations, scalar type hinting, impressive performance benchmarks, Oh my! Check out [his session](http://2016.midcamp.org/session/php-7-new-new-php) and upgrade your servers!

## KSS + Twig = Drupal-accurate static style guides?

We [chased the dream](http://2016.midcamp.org/session/chasing-dream-style-guide-driven-development-drupal-8) of style guide driven development with Brian Perry. What got me excited was seeing how close we are to marrying static style guides with real Drupal templates using [KSS](https://github.com/kneath/kss) and [Twig](http://twig.sensiolabs.org/). No more importing databases, configuring webservers, or managing provisioning scripts for your designer who just wants to work with the plain markup and styles! No more managing (or mis-managing) two sets of templates during development. That's the dream anyway, but we're close! If we can reference a real Drupal Twig template in KSS, then perhaps we can skip all that headache. There's a [pull request](https://github.com/kss-node/kss-node/pull/228) to add a Twig generator on the kss-node project. [ScanKssBundle](https://github.com/scaninc/ScanKssBundle) is another promising project. There's even a [Drupal module](https://www.drupal.org/project/kss) which uses KSS to generate a style guide.

## Big Star makes tasty tacos.

Some of the Austin-based webchefs may take issue with this, but the tacos at [Big Star](http://bigstarchicago.com/) were some of the best I've ever had the pleasure of consuming. Definitely a spot to check out when you're in Chicago for MidCamp 2017.

## Worm Hole does coffee right. Also, time travel.

Need caffeine? Head on over to [Worm Hole](http://www.thewormhole.us/) for some seriously good coffee. Then if coffee isn't your thing, perhaps you'll be enticed by their full-size DeLorean or working NES set up and ready for you to play. I certainly was.

Bottom line, MidCamp is a well organized, well attended event. I thoroughly enjoyed it and plan to go back. Maybe you should too!
